#Cybersecurity Threat Classification with XGBoost

Overview
This project focuses on classifying network traffic into different cybersecurity threat categories using machine learning. The goal is to distinguish between normal (BENIGN) traffic and various cyber attacks, such as DoS Hulk, PortScan, DDoS, Bot, Infiltration, and Heartbleed, using the CICIDS2017 dataset.

The model leverages XGBoost, a powerful gradient-boosting algorithm, due to its effectiveness in handling imbalanced datasets, robustness to noisy network traffic data, and ability to provide feature importance insights.

Key Results
Model Performance
Achieved strong classification performance in distinguishing between different attack types.

High detection rates for common threats like DDoS and PortScans.

Maintained good precision and recall despite severe class imbalance (BENIGN traffic dominates the dataset).

Feature Importance Insights
Identified the most critical network traffic features contributing to threat detection.

Features like Flow Duration, Packet Length, and TCP Flags were among the most significant predictors.

Handling Class Imbalance
Implemented class weighting in XGBoost to improve detection of rare attack types (e.g., Infiltration and Heartbleed).

Future improvements could include SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling) for better minority class representation.

Next Steps
Hyperparameter tuning for further optimization.

Real-time testing on live network traffic.

Deployment as an API for automated threat detection.

This model serves as a strong foundation for automated cybersecurity monitoring systems, helping detect and mitigate network threats efficiently.
